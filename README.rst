Firefox Bookmark Importer
=========================

Just select your bookmark backup file, enter your delicious credentials and wait ;-)

**Hint**: Firefox bookmark backups sometimes contain an extra "*,*" after the last element which will lead to a parsing error. Open the files in your favourite text editor and search for "*,]*" and "*,}*".
